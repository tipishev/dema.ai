I am doing this take home assignment and would like to discuss with you the choice of technologies. I understand that on the simple side of spectrum, I can use bash script or Python/Pandas for the small datasets provided (below 100kb each), and on the complex side it would be spinning up a Redshift cluster. However I am a bit unsure what would be a balanced technology choice, that works both for the small example data, but would scale for more.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
For a balanced approach that meets the scalability and simplicity requirements of your task, here’s what I’d recommend based on your assignment’s needs:

Core Technology Choice:

Python with Pandas and PySpark: Given the manageable file sizes but a potential need for scale, starting with Python and Pandas is appropriate for the initial work with these datasets. However, implementing with PySpark would help make your solution scale-ready for larger data volumes, without requiring extensive infrastructure.
Data Storage and Pipeline Structure:

Local File Storage with Parquet/CSV: Store raw and transformed data in Parquet format (or CSV for simpler access) on your local file system. This setup avoids infrastructure overhead while providing a structured data format suited for analytics and scaling needs.
Modular Pipeline Using Python Scripts: Divide your tasks into modules (e.g., ingesting, transforming, and saving data) with each step saving an intermediate file to ensure clear data lineage and reusability.
Infrastructure and Workflow Management:

Docker and Docker Compose: To meet the requirement for infrastructure as code, containerize your application using Docker. Docker Compose can handle dependencies and setup, making your solution easy to run locally without additional infrastructure.
Optional Scaling Tools (Future-Proofing):

AWS Glue and S3: For scalability, consider AWS Glue for ETL and Amazon S3 for storage if the data volume grows. This would require minimal adjustment if you initially design the pipeline to use Spark for processing.
Redshift or Athena for Querying: You could easily port to Redshift or Athena for large-scale analytical querying on an AWS ecosystem.
Bonus Additions:

Data Validation: Using Python’s great_expectations library to ensure that fields meet expected formats (e.g., date formats, non-null constraints) will be valuable for data integrity.
Report Queries: Include SQL or PySpark queries that aggregate order and inventory data, which could be useful to demonstrate the potential of your pipeline for analytics.
Let me know if you’d like specific help with the code setup for any of these components!




You said:
All right, let's get started. Help me to write a minimal setup that creates a Docker container with AWS Glue v4 image and a simple PySpark script that just echoes the first 10 rows of each file. I will expand it into ingestion script to store the data partitioned by date.

2/2

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To set up a Docker container with an AWS Glue v4 image and a minimal PySpark script, follow these steps. This setup will create a Docker environment that runs Glue’s PySpark environment and outputs the first 10 rows of each file.

Step 1: Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile that uses the AWS Glue v4 base image and installs any necessary dependencies.

dockerfile
Copy code
# Dockerfile

# Use the official AWS Glue version 4 image
FROM amazon/aws-glue-libs:glue_libs_4.0.0_image_01

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy your PySpark script into the container
COPY script.py /app/script.py

# Set the entry point to run the PySpark script
ENTRYPOINT ["spark-submit", "/app/script.py"]
Step 2: PySpark Script (script.py)
Create a PySpark script (script.py) to load each CSV file and display the first 10 rows.

python
Copy code
# script.py

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("AWS Glue Minimal Setup") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Paths to the CSV files
orders_path = "/app/orders.csv"
inventory_path = "/app/inventory.csv"

# Load the datasets
orders_df = spark.read.csv(orders_path, header=True, inferSchema=True)
inventory_df = spark.read.csv(inventory_path, header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Show the first 10 rows of each file
print("Orders Data (first 10 rows):")
orders_df.show(10)

print("Inventory Data (first 10 rows):")
inventory_df.show(10)

# Stop the Spark session
spark.stop()
Step 3: Docker Compose (Optional, for Future Expansion)
If you plan to scale this environment or need additional services, set up docker-compose.yml for container orchestration. For now, it’s not required, so you can directly run the Docker container with docker build and docker run commands.

Step 4: Preparing the Data Files
Place your orders.csv and inventory.csv files in the same directory as the Dockerfile and script. You could also add a step in the Dockerfile to fetch these from a URL or copy them into the container.

Step 5: Build and Run the Docker Container
From the directory with your Dockerfile, script.py, and data files, build and run the Docker container.

bash
Copy code
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t glue-spark-demo .

# Run the Docker container
docker run --rm glue-spark-demo
This setup will display the first 10 rows of each dataset in the container's output. From here, you can expand the script to include additional ingestion and transformation logic, such as storing data partitioned by date. Let me know if you’d like guidance on that next step!




You said:

docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: "spark-submit": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error indicates that spark-submit is not in the $PATH, meaning it’s likely that the AWS Glue Docker image has a different entry point configuration. Let’s modify the Dockerfile to handle this.

Change the ENTRYPOINT Command: Use gluepyspark instead of spark-submit since AWS Glue images typically use this as the entry point for Spark scripts.

Verify File Locations: Ensure that the paths to orders.csv and inventory.csv are correct within the Docker container.

Here’s an updated Dockerfile that should work:

Updated Dockerfile
dockerfile
Copy code
# Dockerfile

# Use the official AWS Glue version 4 image
FROM amazon/aws-glue-libs:glue_libs_4.0.0_image_01

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy your PySpark script into the container
COPY script.py /app/script.py

# Copy data files into the container
COPY orders.csv /app/orders.csv
COPY inventory.csv /app/inventory.csv

# Set the entry point to use gluepyspark
ENTRYPOINT ["gluepyspark", "/app/script.py"]
Build and Run Again
Rebuild and run the container:

bash
Copy code
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t glue-spark-demo .

# Run the Docker container
docker run --rm glue-spark-demo
With this updated configuration, gluepyspark should correctly execute your script.py. Let me know if any issues persist!




You said:
docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: "gluepyspark": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
It seems the gluepyspark command is also not directly available. Let's address this by using the exact path to the PySpark executable provided in the AWS Glue Docker image.

Solution: Use the Full Path to gluepyspark
In the AWS Glue image, gluepyspark is located under /home/glue_user/spark/bin/. Let’s update the Dockerfile to specify this path explicitly.

Revised Dockerfile
dockerfile
Copy code
# Dockerfile

# Use the official AWS Glue version 4 image
FROM amazon/aws-glue-libs:glue_libs_4.0.0_image_01

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy your PySpark script into the container
COPY script.py /app/script.py

# Copy data files into the container
COPY orders.csv /app/orders.csv
COPY inventory.csv /app/inventory.csv

# Use the full path to gluepyspark
ENTRYPOINT ["/home/glue_user/spark/bin/gluepyspark", "/app/script.py"]
Rebuild and Run
Now, rebuild and run the Docker container:

bash
Copy code
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t glue-spark-demo .

# Run the Docker container
docker run --rm glue-spark-demo
This approach uses the full path to gluepyspark and should resolve the issue with the missing executable. Let me know if this works!




You said:
Create a Makefile for build and run
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here's a Makefile to streamline the build and run process for your Docker container:

Makefile
makefile
Copy code
# Define variables
IMAGE_NAME = glue-spark-demo
CONTAINER_NAME = glue-spark-container

# Build the Docker image
build:
	docker build -t $(IMAGE_NAME) .

# Run the Docker container
run:
	docker run --rm --name $(CONTAINER_NAME) $(IMAGE_NAME)

# Clean up any dangling images (optional)
clean:
	docker rmi $(IMAGE_NAME)

# Combine build and run in a single command
all: build run
Usage
Build the Docker image: make build
Run the Docker container: make run
Clean up the Docker image: make clean (optional)
Build and Run: make all
This Makefile makes it easy to manage your Docker workflow by simplifying the commands. Let me know if you need additional targets or modifications!




You said:
add a Make command to open a bash shell, I cannot find the Spark executable in the image.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To open a bash shell in the Docker container, you can add a shell command to the Makefile. This will start an interactive shell session so you can explore the container and locate the Spark executable.

Updated Makefile
makefile
Copy code
# Define variables
IMAGE_NAME = glue-spark-demo
CONTAINER_NAME = glue-spark-container

# Build the Docker image
build:
	docker build -t $(IMAGE_NAME) .

# Run the Docker container
run:
	docker run --rm --name $(CONTAINER_NAME) $(IMAGE_NAME)

# Open an interactive bash shell in the container
shell:
	docker run --rm -it --name $(CONTAINER_NAME) $(IMAGE_NAME) /bin/bash

# Clean up any dangling images (optional)
clean:
	docker rmi $(IMAGE_NAME)

# Combine build and run in a single command
all: build run
Usage
Open a bash shell: make shell
This command will start a bash session inside the container, allowing you to search for the Spark executable location and test commands interactively. Let me know if you need further adjustments!




You said:
/bin/bash: /bin/bash: cannot execute binary file
make: *** [shell] Error 126
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error suggests that the base image used by AWS Glue might not have /bin/bash. Instead, it may use /bin/sh as the default shell. Let’s update the Makefile to try using /bin/sh for the interactive shell.

Updated Makefile with /bin/sh for Shell Access
makefile
Copy code
# Define variables
IMAGE_NAME = glue-spark-demo
CONTAINER_NAME = glue-spark-container

# Build the Docker image
build:
	docker build -t $(IMAGE_NAME) .

# Run the Docker container
run:
	docker run --rm --name $(CONTAINER_NAME) $(IMAGE_NAME)

# Open an interactive shell in the container
shell:
	docker run --rm -it --name $(CONTAINER_NAME) $(IMAGE_NAME) /bin/sh

# Clean up any dangling images (optional)
clean:
	docker rmi $(IMAGE_NAME)

# Combine build and run in a single command
all: build run
Usage
Open a shell using /bin/sh: make shell
This should allow you to enter an interactive shell using /bin/sh. Once inside, you can check the directories for gluepyspark or spark-submit, usually located under directories like /usr/local/bin/, /home/glue_user/spark/bin/, or similar paths. Let me know if this allows you to access the container’s shell!




You said:
how to start an interactive bash session inside the container?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the AWS Glue container doesn’t support /bin/bash directly, you can try using /bin/sh, as it should be available in most Linux-based containers. Here’s how to start an interactive shell session using /bin/sh inside the container.

Option 1: Using Makefile
Ensure your Makefile includes the shell target as follows:

makefile
Copy code
# Open an interactive shell in the container
shell:
	docker run --rm -it --name $(CONTAINER_NAME) $(IMAGE_NAME) /bin/sh
Then, run:

bash
Copy code
make shell
Option 2: Using docker run Directly
If you prefer to start a shell session directly with docker run instead of the Makefile, use:

bash
Copy code
docker run --rm -it glue-spark-demo /bin/sh
Checking for /bin/bash in the Container
Once inside the container, you can check if bash is available:

sh
Copy code
which bash
If bash is installed, you can switch to it by typing:

sh
Copy code
bash
If it’s unavailable, you can still explore and run commands with /bin/sh. Let me know if this helps!

Here’s how to modify your Dockerfile and Makefile to reflect the command you successfully used.

Updated Dockerfile
In this updated Dockerfile, we ensure the environment variable DISABLE_SSL is set to true and set up a default command using spark-submit to run your script.

dockerfile
Copy code
# Dockerfile

# Use the official AWS Glue version 4 image
FROM amazon/aws-glue-libs:glue_libs_4.0.0_image_01

# Set working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /home/glue_user/workspace

# Copy the PySpark script and data files into the workspace directory
COPY script.py /home/glue_user/workspace/script.py
COPY orders.csv /home/glue_user/workspace/orders.csv
COPY inventory.csv /home/glue_user/workspace/inventory.csv

# Set the DISABLE_SSL environment variable to true
ENV DISABLE_SSL=true

# Expose the Spark UI ports for monitoring
EXPOSE 4040 18080

# Set the default command to run the PySpark script
CMD ["spark-submit", "/home/glue_user/workspace/script.py"]
Updated Makefile
The Makefile now uses the command you confirmed works. It includes the DISABLE_SSL environment variable and mounts the current directory to /home/glue_user/workspace/, exposing ports for Spark UI access.

makefile
Copy code
# Define variables
IMAGE_NAME = glue-spark-demo
CONTAINER_NAME = glue_spark_submit

# Build the Docker image
build:
	docker build -t $(IMAGE_NAME) .

# Run the Docker container with necessary ports and environment variables
run:
	docker run -it \
		-v $(PWD):/home/glue_user/workspace/ \
		-e DISABLE_SSL=true \
		--rm \
		-p 4040:4040 \

Write ingest.py that reads the files and stores them as partitioned parquet files:
* inventory on category
* orders on date
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here’s a basic ingest.py script to read the orders.csv and inventory.csv files, then save them as partitioned Parquet files:

inventory.csv will be partitioned by category.
orders.csv will be partitioned by date (extracted from the dateTime column).
ingest.py
python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, to_date

# Initialize a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Ingest Data and Partition") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Define input paths for CSV files
orders_path = "/home/glue_user/workspace/orders.csv"
inventory_path = "/home/glue_user/workspace/inventory.csv"

# Define output paths for partitioned Parquet files
orders_output_path = "/home/glue_user/workspace/output/orders_partitioned"
inventory_output_path = "/home/glue_user/workspace/output/inventory_partitioned"

# Load the Orders dataset and partition by date (extracted from dateTime)
orders_df = spark.read.csv(orders_path, header=True, inferSchema=True)
orders_df = orders_df.withColumn("date", to_date(col("dateTime")))  # Extract date from dateTime
orders_df.write.partitionBy("date").parquet(orders_output_path, mode="overwrite")

# Load the Inventory dataset and partition by category
inventory_df = spark.read.csv(inventory_path, header=True, inferSchema=True)
inventory_df.write.partitionBy("category").parquet(inventory_output_path, mode="overwrite")

# Stop the Spark session
spark.stop()
Explanation
SparkSession: Starts a new Spark session.
Orders Partitioning:
Reads orders.csv.
Adds a date column by extracting the date from dateTime.
Writes the DataFrame as Parquet files, partitioned by the date column.
Inventory Partitioning:
Reads inventory.csv.
Writes the DataFrame as Parquet files, partitioned by the category column.
Directory Structure
The output will be saved in output/orders_partitioned/ and output/inventory_partitioned/ folders, with subfolders for each partition value (e.g., date=2023-02-01/, category=Shoes/).

You can run this script with the spark-submit command in your Docker container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -it -v .:/home/glue_user/workspace/ -e DISABLE_SSL=true --rm -p 4040:4040 -p 18080:18080 --name glue_spark_submit amazon/aws-glue-libs:glue_libs_4.0.0_image_01 spark-submit /home/glue_user/workspace/ingest.py
This setup will read and partition the data as Parquet files, which are efficient for storage and analytics. Let me know if you’d like further modifications!

Write an example aggregation query.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here’s an example aggregation query in PySpark that calculates some useful metrics from the ingested data:

Total Order Amount and Quantity per Day: Summing amount and quantity for each date in orders.
Total Inventory Quantity per Category: Summing quantity for each category in inventory.
Example Aggregation Script (aggregate.py)
This script reads the partitioned Parquet files from the ingestion step and performs the aggregations.

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import sum as spark_sum

# Initialize a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Aggregation Query") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Paths to the partitioned Parquet files
orders_parquet_path = "/home/glue_user/workspace/output/orders_partitioned"
inventory_parquet_path = "/home/glue_user/workspace/output/inventory_partitioned"

# Load the partitioned orders data
orders_df = spark.read.parquet(orders_parquet_path)

# 1. Calculate total order amount and quantity per day
daily_orders_summary = orders_df.groupBy("date") \
    .agg(
        spark_sum("amount").alias("total_amount"),
        spark_sum("quantity").alias("total_quantity")
    )

print("Total Order Amount and Quantity per Day:")
daily_orders_summary.show()

# Load the partitioned inventory data
inventory_df = spark.read.parquet(inventory_parquet_path)

# 2. Calculate total inventory quantity per category
category_inventory_summary = inventory_df.groupBy("category") \
    .agg(
        spark_sum("quantity").alias("total_inventory_quantity")
    )

print("Total Inventory Quantity per Category:")
category_inventory_summary.show()

# Stop the Spark session
spark.stop()
Explanation
Daily Orders Summary:

Groups by date in orders data.
Aggregates by summing amount and quantity columns.
Provides total amount and quantity per day.
Category Inventory Summary:

Groups by category in inventory data.
Aggregates by summing quantity for each category, giving total stock available per category.
Running the Aggregation Script
To run this script with the Docker setup:

Add aggregate.py to the same directory.

Update the Makefile with a new aggregate target:

makefile
Copy code
# Run the aggregation script in the Docker container
aggregate:
    docker run -it \
        -v $(PWD):/home/glue_user/workspace/ \
        -e DISABLE_SSL=true \
        --rm \
        -p 4040:4040 \
        -p 18080:18080 \
        --name $(CONTAINER_NAME) \
        $(IMAGE_NAME) spark-submit /home/glue_user/workspace/aggregate.py
Run the aggregation with:

bash
Copy code
make aggregate
This will output the daily order totals and category-level inventory totals in the console. Let me know if you need further customization!




You said:

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Memory updated
Thanks for the update! Here’s the revised aggregate.py script to reflect the new data paths:

Updated aggregate.py
python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import sum as spark_sum

# Initialize a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Aggregation Query") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Updated paths to the partitioned Parquet files
orders_parquet_path = "/home/glue_user/workspace/data/orders"
inventory_parquet_path = "/home/glue_user/workspace/data/inventory"

# Load the partitioned orders data
orders_df = spark.read.parquet(orders_parquet_path)

# 1. Calculate total order amount and quantity per day
daily_orders_summary = orders_df.groupBy("date") \
    .agg(
        spark_sum("amount").alias("total_amount"),
        spark_sum("quantity").alias("total_quantity")
    )

print("Total Order Amount and Quantity per Day:")
daily_orders_summary.show()

# Load the partitioned inventory data
inventory_df = spark.read.parquet(inventory_parquet_path)

# 2. Calculate total inventory quantity per category
category_inventory_summary = inventory_df.groupBy("category") \
    .agg(
        spark_sum("quantity").alias("total_inventory_quantity")
    )

print("Total Inventory Quantity per Category:")
category_inventory_summary.show()

# Stop the Spark session
spark.stop()
This script now reads from data/orders and data/inventory as specified. Adjust the paths in the Makefile as needed, and you should be all set! Let me know if there’s anything more to tweak.

To deduplicate your Makefile, you can create a variable for the common Docker run options and reuse it across different targets. Here’s a streamlined version:

Deduplicated Makefile
makefile
Copy code
# Define variables
IMAGE_NAME = glue-spark-demo
CONTAINER_NAME = glue_spark_submit
DOCKER_RUN_OPTS = -it -v $(PWD):/home/glue_user/workspace/ -e DISABLE_SSL=true --rm -p 4040:4040 -p 18080:18080 --name $(CONTAINER_NAME)

# Build the Docker image
build:
	docker build -t $(IMAGE_NAME) .

# Run the ingestion script in the Docker container
ingest:
	docker run $(DOCKER_RUN_OPTS) $(IMAGE_NAME) spark-submit /home/glue_user/workspace/ingest.py

# Run the aggregation script in the Docker container
aggregate:
	docker run $(DOCKER_RUN_OPTS) $(IMAGE_NAME) spark-submit /home/glue_user/workspace/aggregate.py

# Open an interactive shell in the container
shell:
	docker run $(DOCKER_RUN_OPTS) $(IMAGE_NAME) /bin/sh

# Clean up any dangling images
clean:
	docker rmi $(IMAGE_NAME)

# Combine build and ingestion run in a single command
all: build ingest
Explanation
DOCKER_RUN_OPTS: Defines common options for running the Docker container, including volume mounting, environment variables, and port mappings.
Each target reuses $(DOCKER_RUN_OPTS), so only the specific script or command differs per target.
This setup keeps your Makefile cleaner and minimizes repeated code. Let me know if you’d like additional improvements!




You said:
Can you create an aggregation query but with Glue SQL?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To create an aggregation query using AWS Glue SQL, we can use Glue’s SQL-based approach to perform aggregations directly within a Glue job. This approach typically leverages AWS Glue’s Data Catalog for querying tables registered in the catalog.

Below is an example query setup that calculates:

Total Order Amount and Quantity per Day from orders.
Total Inventory Quantity per Category from inventory.
Prerequisites
Create Glue Tables:

You’ll need to register the orders and inventory tables in the AWS Glue Data Catalog with appropriate schemas, and ensure they point to the Parquet files in data/orders and data/inventory.
Glue SQL Script:

Write SQL-based queries using AWS Glue’s SQL editor or include them within a Glue job script.
Glue SQL Script (glue_sql_aggregations.sql)
Here’s an example script that you can use within a Glue job:

sql
Copy code
-- Total Order Amount and Quantity per Day
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE daily_orders_summary
AS SELECT 
    date,
    SUM(amount) AS total_amount,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM glue_catalog.database_name.orders
GROUP BY date;

-- Total Inventory Quantity per Category
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE category_inventory_summary
AS SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_inventory_quantity
FROM glue_catalog.database_name.inventory
GROUP BY category;

-- Select results to preview
SELECT * FROM daily_orders_summary;
SELECT * FROM category_inventory_summary;
Explanation
First Query (daily_orders_summary):
Aggregates amount and quantity columns in orders by date, providing total sales and quantities per day.
Second Query (category_inventory_summary):
Aggregates quantity in inventory by category, providing total available stock per category.
Running the Query in a Glue Job
Set Up the Glue Job:

In AWS Glue, create a new job with Glue SQL as the job type.
Specify your glue_sql_aggregations.sql script in the job’s SQL editor or as a file in an S3 location.
Configure Output:

The output of temporary tables (daily_orders_summary and category_inventory_summary) can be directed to S3 for further analysis or used within the same job for additional transformations.
This SQL approach leverages Glue’s built-in capabilities for data transformation, making it efficient for aggregating large datasets registered in the Glue Data Catalog. Let me know if you need further guidance on deploying or modifying this setup!




You said:
Interesting. But can I run something SQL-like locally in the Docker image?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can run SQL-like queries locally within the AWS Glue Docker image using Spark SQL. Spark SQL lets you register DataFrames as temporary views and then query them using SQL syntax. Here’s how you could adapt your aggregation logic to run within the local Glue Docker environment.

Updated aggregate.py Using Spark SQL
This script loads the Parquet files, registers them as temporary views, and then runs SQL queries to perform the aggregations.

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("SQL Aggregation Query") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Paths to the partitioned Parquet files
orders_parquet_path = "/home/glue_user/workspace/data/orders"
inventory_parquet_path = "/home/glue_user/workspace/data/inventory"

# Load the partitioned orders data and inventory data
orders_df = spark.read.parquet(orders_parquet_path)
inventory_df = spark.read.parquet(inventory_parquet_path)

# Register the DataFrames as temporary views to query with SQL
orders_df.createOrReplaceTempView("orders")
inventory_df.createOrReplaceTempView("inventory")

# SQL query: Total Order Amount and Quantity per Day
daily_orders_summary = spark.sql("""
    SELECT 
        date,
        SUM(amount) AS total_amount,
        SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY date
""")

print("Total Order Amount and Quantity per Day:")
daily_orders_summary.show()

# SQL query: Total Inventory Quantity per Category
category_inventory_summary = spark.sql("""
    SELECT 
        category,
        SUM(quantity) AS total_inventory_quantity
    FROM inventory
    GROUP BY category
""")

print("Total Inventory Quantity per Category:")
category_inventory_summary.show()

# Stop the Spark session
spark.stop()
Explanation
Register DataFrames as Views:

orders_df.createOrReplaceTempView("orders") allows you to treat the orders DataFrame as a SQL table.
inventory_df.createOrReplaceTempView("inventory") does the same for inventory.
Run SQL Queries:

The spark.sql() function executes SQL queries on the registered views.
Output:

The show() function displays the query results directly.
Running the Script Locally in Docker
To run this script with the Glue Docker container:

Save it as aggregate.py.

Use the following make aggregate command in the Makefile:

makefile
Copy code
# Run the aggregation script with Spark SQL in the Docker container
aggregate:
    docker run -it \
        -v $(PWD):/home/glue_user/workspace/ \
        -e DISABLE_SSL=true \
        --rm \
        -p 4040:4040 \
        -p 18080:18080 \
        --name $(CONTAINER_NAME) \
        $(IMAGE_NAME) spark-submit /home/glue_user/workspace/aggregate.py
This setup will run the SQL-like aggregation locally, making it convenient to develop and test your Glue jobs in a SQL-style format before deployment. Let me know if you need more guidance!

You said:
I want to add some simple data quality check that can be run after ingestion.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Adding data quality checks after ingestion can help ensure that your data meets expected standards. Here’s how to implement basic data quality checks for:

Non-null Checks: Ensures critical columns do not contain null values.
Unique Constraints: Verifies that certain fields (like orderId in orders and productId in inventory) are unique.
Value Range Checks: Ensures numerical columns fall within a sensible range (e.g., quantity > 0).
Example Data Quality Check Script (quality_check.py)
This script uses PySpark to read the partitioned Parquet files and performs checks. It outputs any issues found.

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Data Quality Checks") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Paths to partitioned Parquet files
orders_parquet_path = "/home/glue_user/workspace/data/orders"
inventory_parquet_path = "/home/glue_user/workspace/data/inventory"

# Load data
orders_df = spark.read.parquet(orders_parquet_path)
inventory_df = spark.read.parquet(inventory_parquet_path)

# Function to print data quality check results
def check_data_quality(df, description):
    if df.count() > 0:
        print(f"Data Quality Issue: {description}")
        df.show()
    else:
        print(f"No issues found for: {description}")

# 1. Non-null Checks
check_data_quality(
    orders_df.filter(col("orderId").isNull()), 
    "orders: Null values in orderId"
)
check_data_quality(
    inventory_df.filter(col("productId").isNull()), 
    "inventory: Null values in productId"
)

# 2. Unique Constraints
check_data_quality(
    orders_df.groupBy("orderId").count().filter(col("count") > 1), 
    "orders: Duplicate orderId"
)
check_data_quality(
    inventory_df.groupBy("productId").count().filter(col("count") > 1), 
    "inventory: Duplicate productId"
)

# 3. Value Range Checks
check_data_quality(
    orders_df.filter(col("quantity") <= 0), 
    "orders: quantity <= 0"
)
check_data_quality(
    inventory_df.filter(col("quantity") <= 0), 
    "inventory: quantity <= 0"
)

# Stop the Spark session
spark.stop()
Explanation of the Checks
Non-null Checks: Identifies rows where orderId or productId is null, which would indicate missing critical identifiers.
Unique Constraints: Groups by orderId and productId and checks for duplicates.
Value Range Checks: Ensures that quantity values are positive.
Adding to the Makefile
To run this quality check after ingestion, add a new target in the Makefile:

makefile
Copy code
# Run the data quality check script in the Docker container
quality_check:
	docker run $(DOCKER_RUN_OPTS) $(IMAGE_NAME) spark-submit /home/glue_user/workspace/quality_check.py
Running the Check
Execute the following command to run the quality check:

bash
Copy code
make quality_check
This will output any rows that fail the checks, making it easy to identify and correct data quality issues. Let me know if you’d like to add additional checks or enhance this setup!
